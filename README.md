# Challenge 1
## Horiseon Home Page

### Description 
The Horiseon Home Page has semantic HTML elements that follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning. The image elements are working, there are accessible alt attributes, and the heading attributes fall into a sequential order. I used HTML and CSS. 

### My experience
I learned how to deal with challenges by watching Scott work on this during office hours (we all have the same code).
